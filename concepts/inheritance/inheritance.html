	 This code shows how to define classes and setup inheritance in plain javascript.
	 Idea is to modify prototype of child class with new instance of base class. There 
	 has to be new instanance of base for every new child otherwise they would be sharing
	 properties.
	 Second step is to call constructor of base class in child constructor to ensure all props
	 are properly initialized.

	/*
	Helper method to setup inheritance of objects
	Parameters
		derived - derived class we want to decorate with base class functionality
		base - base class that should be used as parent type of derived class.
			   when calling ctor from derived class, note you shall not use
			   this.baseCtor but [name].baseCtor.call(this) where [name] is 
			   name of your class. Statement "call(this)" ensures that context
			   of the method (parent ctor) is called in context of current (derived)
			   instance. See also documenation for javascript "call" and "apply" for
			   more details (e.g. passing parameters).
